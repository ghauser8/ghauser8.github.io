            <h1>Are you sure you want optimality?</h1>
            <h3>Why "optimal" solutions are more distractions than solutions.</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="blogPostBody">
            <p>For a first blog post, why not dive straight into controversy?</p>
            <p>For somebody like me, who's expertise is predicated on the notion that 
                I can take a real-world problem, model it in mathematical terms, and 
                then return an optimal solution, optimality feels like an airtight 
                case for employment if not an outright requirement. It sells well: 
                "Give me your problem and I'll give you a solution that nobody can 
                beat!" By definition, an optimal solution cannot be improved upon,
                and if you ask anybody who is in charge of running some kind 
                of business, process, system, etc., each of them will want to 
                convince you that they're operating "optimally." Maybe even more 
                importantly, if that same professional has decided that for some 
                reason their ward is <em>not</em> performing optimally, they 
                probably won't tell their boss that they're seeking a consultant 
                who promises <em>sub</em>optimal solutions.
            </p>
            <p>There is a very easy technical case that can be made under special 
                circumstances for suboptimal solutions: heuristic approaches 
                for large, computationally complex problems (think 50 city travelling
                salesmen problems, or similarly difficult combinatorial problems) are 
                widely accepted purely on the basis of how much time it can take 
                to calculate an optimal solution.
