                <h3>Academic Experiences and Focus</h3>
                <p>
                    I earned my Bachelors in Industrial Engineering 
                    and my Masters and PhD in Operations Research at NC State in Raleigh, NC. 
                    My training as an industrial engineer gave me the basic tools for 
                    problems associated with production and service systems: factory design
                    and planning, inventory management, service system planning, supply 
                    chain optimization, forecasting, and the like. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    My graduate work took me deeper into the fundamental methods that 
                    underpin most of these problems. In my disseration I study the 
                    application of linear and mixed integer programming principles 
                    to matching theory, a subfield of Microeconomics. The primary 
                    research questions are concerned with fairly allocating scarce,
                    indivisible goods to diverse populations. Common applications
                    include school choice problems where students have preferences
                    over which school they are assigned to and the schools have 
                    affirmative action style policies by which they must abide.

                <h3>Professional Experiences</h3>
                <p>
                    Through my academic career I worked a variety of internships and co-ops
                    at companies including Hanesbrands and Tesla. While in grad school, I 
                    worked with NCGrowth doing pro-bono consulting for small, local 
                    manufacturers in NC. I funded part of my PhD with the SMART Scholarship 
                    via the DoD, which led me to my current position with the Army Futures
                    Command as an Operations Analyst.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my time at Hanesbrands, I worked with their logistics group to 
                    develop a tool that forecasts the shipping requirements at all 
                    ports given the previously agreed upon production schedule.
                    Hanesbrands has production facilities across the world, many of
                    which are in southeast Asia. My work offered to reduce shipping 
                    costs by arming Hanesbrands with better estimates of how many 
                    shipping containers would be required at each port, thus 
                    improving their negotiating position with carriers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My work at Tesla gave me a broad range of manufacturing experience. 
                    In the Gigafactory in Sparks, NV, I started working with one of 
                    the more mature assembly lines where I developed live dashboards
                    in Tableau to calculate and communicate machine availability. 
                    The second half of my co-op was spent with an assembly line 
                    that was under ongoing construction. In the shuffle, I secured 
                    the project of designing and testing prototypes of an assembly 
                    line that would serve as a temporary solution while the main 
                    line was down. The final iteration of my design was green-lit 
                    by higher management and implemented to meet production goals.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Working with NCGrowth allowed me to apply the lessons and 
                    principles learned at Tesla to traditional manufacturing 
                    environments. I used time and motion studies to design 
                    assembly lines for a small furniture manufacturer in 
                    High Point, NC. These and other methods reduced the 
                    overall variability suffered by the system, which 
                    in turn reduced cycle times and improved production 
                    capacity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Working with the Army Future Command has been an 
                    excellent experience. My team's analysis contributes 
                    to planning efforts for the US Army of 2035 and beyond
                    by suggesting requirements, assessing risk, and highlighting
                    critical areas for operational level improvements. Many 
                    of our studies are carried out via large scale discrete 
                    event simulations and the attendant data analytics.
                    The problems we face are often wide-ranging and ill-defined,
                    requiring novel approaches and highly functional working 
                    relationships with external stakeholders and decision makers.

                <h3>Technical Expertise and Skillsets</h3>
                <p>
                    Through my academic and work experience I've collected some 
                    speicifc expertise and a vareity of technical skillsets. I 
                    am an expert in the theory and application of mathematical 
                    modelling, optimization, and simulation. In particular, my
                    modelling and optimization expertise is focused on mixed 
                    integer and linear programming (MILP), combinatorial 
                    programming, heuristics (development, implementation, 
                    and assessment), and computational complexity theory.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am comfortable exercising my expertise with both open-source
                    and commercial tools. My primary programming language is Python,
                    followed by R and JavaScript. For writing and solving mathematical 
                    models, I am an expert with Gurobi; my choice for open-source 
                    based modelling and solving is Pyomo and the GLPK package in Python.
                    I use object oriented programming practices in Python to develop 
                    simulations, and have experience with "heavy object" type commercial
                    simmulation tools such as Simio.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have built web-based applications with R-Shiny, extensive 
                    statistical analysis with R, basic website construction with 
                    JavaScript, HTML, and CSS (this website, for example), and 
                    SQL-driven dashboards in Tableau. I expect any work opportunity
                    to involve learning new programming languages and extending my 
                    current capability for implementing, developing, or communicating 
                    analysis.
